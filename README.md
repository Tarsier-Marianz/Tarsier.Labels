# Tarsier.Labels

A simple extended version of default Windows Forms [**Label**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.label(v=vs.110).aspx) control.


[Label Control (Windows Forms)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/label-control-windows-forms ) controls are used to display text or images that cannot be edited by the user. They are used to identify objects on a formâ€”to provide a description of what a certain control will do if clicked, for example, or to display information in response to a run-time event or process in your application. Because the Label control cannot receive focus, it can also be used to create access keys for other controls.
